### **Boltzmann Machine (BM)**

#### **Introduction**
- Named after **Ludwig Boltzmann**, the Boltzmann Machine is a **recurrent neural network** designed for **constraint satisfaction problems** and **combinatorial optimization**.  
- It combines the ideas of the **Hopfield network** and **Simulated Annealing** to overcome the limitation of Hopfield networks, which often get stuck in **local minima**.  
- The network models **Content Addressable Memory (CAM)** and finds a **globally optimal state** for tasks with interacting constraints.

#### **Key Features**
1. **Global Optimization**:  
   - Unlike Hopfield networks, the Boltzmann Machine can escape local minima to find the **global minimum** of the system's energy function.  
   - Achieved through **simulated annealing**, a process that gradually reduces randomness in updates (analogous to cooling in physical annealing).  

2. **Constraint Satisfaction**:  
   - Solves problems like the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** or **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** by finding states that satisfy the most constraints.  

3. **Distributed Representation**:  
   - Uses a network of visible and hidden units, similar to the human brain, to represent and learn patterns.  

4. **No Clear Input-Output Boundary**:  
   - Unlike feedforward networks, Boltzmann Machines do not distinctly separate input and output layers, making them suitable for complex unsupervised learning tasks.

- **State Probability**:  
  The probability of a state \(s\) is determined by the Boltzmann distribution:
  \[
  P(s) = \frac{e^{-E(s) / T}}{\sum_{s'} e^{-E(s') / T}}
  \]
  - \(T\): Temperature (controls randomness).

#### **Applications**
1. **Constraint Satisfaction**:  
   - Solving optimization problems like TSP or MST.  

2. **Classification Problems**:  
   - Performs tasks like pattern recognition and neural modeling.  

3. **Symbolic Learning**:  
   - Learns symbolic concepts and descriptions for knowledge-intensive tasks.  

4. **Feature Learning**:  
   - Extracts features through interactions between visible and hidden layers.
