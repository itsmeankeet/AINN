# Support Vector Machines (SVM) Classification

## Objective
Implement and understand Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification using Python and scikit-learn.

## Theory
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane separating different classes by maximizing the margin between data points.

## Key Algorithm Characteristics
- Supervised learning technique
- Effective for binary and multiclass classification
- Works well with high-dimensional data
- Uses kernel tricks for non-linear separation
- Robust to overfitting

## Implementation Steps
1. Prepare input data
2. Scale features
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Initialize SVM model
5. Train the classifier
6. Evaluate model performance
7. Visualize decision boundary

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Potential Challenges
- Sensitive to feature scaling
- Computationally intensive for large datasets
- Choosing appropriate kernel
- Handling imbalanced datasets

## Recommended Improvements
- Feature normalization
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Trying different kernel types

## Typical Applications
- Image classification
- Handwriting recognition
- Bioinformatics
- Medical diagnosis
- Text categorization
